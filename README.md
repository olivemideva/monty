# The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

## Compilation

The program will be compiled using:

```Bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
